# 1 Project Overview

## 1.1 Project Purpose: Learning‑Based
- **10 minutes**  – Download and share your parameter information  
- **100 minutes** – Practice your ideas on the RC505MKII  
- **1000 minutes** – Listen to lots of music and study related theory  

## 1.2 Documentation Format: Share‑Based
- **Highly standardized** – fixed template format, including: one audio‑info file, one summary‑info file, one MIDI document  
- **Highly extensible**  – software stack needs only RC505MKII, Ableton Live, and a data cable  
- **Highly visual**      – with an Ableton Live project file, the musical structure is clear at a glance  

## 1.3 Project Content: Technology‑Based
- **Free control**      – expanded control via MIDI CC  
- **Infinite tones**    – extend four effects to eight voices via the SUB→INST interface for unlimited tone design  
- **Automated control** – note input via MIDI NOTE and automation via Ableton Live  

# 2 Why Create This Project?

Anyone with programming experience knows that reading—or even rewriting—the source code of top programmers and authoritative companies is one of the fastest ways to level up. Copying all of this project’s parameters directly into your RC505MKII is indeed an efficient path to quick progress.

However, mechanically copying someone else’s work without clear learning goals will not boost your creative thinking. Note that my own skill level is only slightly above that of someone who’s written code for one extra week. Therefore, follow Principle One: quickly understand how these parameters work, and spend most of your time creating something that’s uniquely yours.

# 3 Guidelines

You must follow Principles One, Two, and Three below:

## 3.1 Prerequisites

You need to master three basic beatbox sounds: the **kick drum**, the **snare/crack**, and the **lip bass** (note: lip bass is _not_ produced from the center of the lips). This isn’t to say you shouldn’t continue improving your beatbox skills—in fact, you must keep learning to push your limits, harness your creativity, and break through the impossible to forge your own original signature.

## 3.2 Principle One: 3‑3‑3‑3 Workflow – All Copying Aims at Better Originality

The third step is especially critical:

1. **10 minutes: Plug‑and‑Play**  
   Copy every operation from `parameters.md` into your RC505MKII and get it running. Record your initial creative ideas and upload them as a `.md` file to the repo.

2. **100 minutes: Original Ideas**  
   Tweak parameters and effect chains on top of `parameters.md` until you discover an improved combination—this becomes your original work.

3. **1000 minutes: Creative Power**  
   Listen intensively to music in the target style. Purposefully build your music‑theory foundation to prepare for crafting truly original pieces.

## 3.3 Principle Two: Tech Sharing – RC505MKII‑Centric, Ableton Live‑Extended Parameter Exchange

1. You need only an **RC505MKII**.  
2. You also need a **computer** to control and log your RC505MKII parameters.  
3. **Hardware is limited to the RC505MKII**. No Launchpads, extra MIDI controllers, LINE 6 STOMP units, etc., are allowed.

|                | Hardware        | Software               |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Effects**    | RC505MKII only  | Not allowed            |
| **MIDI**       | Not allowed     | Controlled by Ableton Live |

**Why these restrictions?**  
1. **Standardization** – Everyone uses the same RC505MKII + Ableton Live setup, so sharing is as simple as uploading an Ableton Live file and a `parameters.md`.  
2. **Cost‑effectiveness** – No need for Loopy Pro, LINE 6 STOMP, or Launchpad; an RC505MKII covers most effects, and the free Ableton Live trial handles MIDI Note/CC.  
3. **Zero additional fees** – Beyond basic internet and electricity, this GitHub/Gitee project is free.

## 3.4 Principle Three: Creative Habit – Record and Backup Your Parameters Promptly

At the 2024 CNB competition, I wasn’t familiar with the computer‑side of my Launchpad MK3 Pro and accidentally overwrote every project with an empty one—losing my backup and missing the competition.

## 3.5 Questions to Ponder: What Kind of Music Do You/We Really Want to Create?

We can’t stay at the level of mere appreciation; we must actively reproduce and create within the musical symbol system. In programming terms, it’s like studying algorithms: understanding existing code isn’t enough—you must innovate new solutions and programs to truly master the craft.
